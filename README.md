Write a program that determines if a given year is a leap year. Leap years are those years that are divisible by four, except that century years not divisible by 400 are not leap years. For example, 1960, 1996, and 2000 are leap years, while 1961, 1995, and 1900 are not.

Your program should ask the user to enter a year and then determine whether that year is a leap year. 

Your program should use at least two different algorithms/solutions
